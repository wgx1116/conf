daemon  on;  # daemon on | off; Default: daemon on; -- Determines whether nginx should become a daemon. Mainly used during development.
user  www;  # user user [group]; Default: user nobody nobody; -- Defines user and group credentials used by worker processes. If group is omitted, a group whose name equals that of user is used.
# master_process on;  # master_process on | off; Default: master_process on; -- Determines whether worker processes are started. This directive is intended for nginx developers.
worker_processes  2;  # worker_processes number | auto; Default: worker_processes 1; -- Defines the number of worker processes.
# worker_cpu_affinity  # worker_cpu_affinity cpumask ...; worker_cpu_affinity auto [cpumask]; Default: --; -- Binds worker processes to the sets of CPUs.
# worker_priority 0;  # worker_priority number; Default: worker_priority 0; -- Defines the scheduling priority for worker processes like it is done by the nice command: a negative number means higher priority. Allowed range normally varies from -20 to 20.
# worker_rlimit_core;  # worker_rlimit_core size; Default: --; -- Changes the limit on the largest size of a core file (RLIMIT_CORE) for worker processes.
# worker_rlimit_nofile;  # worker_rlimit_nofile number; Default: --; -- Changes the limit on the maximum number of open files (RLIMIT_NOFILE) for worker processes.
# worker_shutdown_timeout;  # worker_rlimit_nofile number; Default: --; -- Configures a timeout for a graceful shutdown of worker processes. When the time expires, nginx will try to close all the connections currently open to facilitate shutdown.

pid  /run/nginx.pid;  # pid file; Default: pid logs/nginx.pid; -- Defines a file that will store the process ID of the main process.
lock_file  /run/nginx.lock;  # lock_file file; Default: lock_file logs/nginx.lock; -- nginx uses the locking mechanism to implement accept_mutex and serialize access to shared memory.

# thread_pool  # thread_pool name threads=number [max_queue=number]; Default: thread_pool default threads=32 max_queue=65536; -- Defines named thread pools used for multi-threaded reading and sending of files without blocking worker processes.

# env TZ;  # env variable[=value]; Default: env TZ; -- By default, nginx removes all environment variables inherited from its parent process except the TZ variable. This directive allows preserving some of the inherited variables, changing their values, or creating new environment variables.
# timer_resolution;  # timer_resolution interval; Default: --; -- Reduces timer resolution in worker processes, thus reducing the number of gettimeofday() system calls made. By default, gettimeofday() is called each time a kernel event is received. With reduced resolution, gettimeofday() is only called once per specified interval.
# pcre_jit off;  # pcre_jit on | off; Default: pcre_jit off; -- Enables or disables the use of “just-in-time compilation” (PCRE JIT) for the regular expressions known by the time of configuration parsing.
# ssl_engine;  # ssl_engine device; Default: --; -- Defines the name of the hardware SSL accelerator.

# load_module;  # load_module file; Default: --; -- Loads a dynamic module.

# debug_points;  # debug_points abort | stop; Default: --; -- This directive is used for debugging. When internal error is detected, e.g. the leak of sockets on restart of working processes, enabling debug_points leads to a core file creation (abort) or to stopping of a process (stop) for further analysis using a system debugger.
# working_directory;  # working_directory directory; Default: --; -- Defines the current working directory for a worker process. It is primarily used when writing a core-file, in which case a worker process should have write permission for the specified directory.
error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log  error;  # error_log file [level]; Default: error_log logs/error.log error; -- Configures logging. Several logs can be specified on the same level (1.5.2). If on the main configuration level writing a log to a file is not explicitly defined, the default file will be used.
error_log  /var/log/nginx/info.log  info;
