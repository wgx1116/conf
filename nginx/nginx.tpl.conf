# worker_priority 0;  # worker_priority number; Default: worker_priority 0; Context: main -- Defines the scheduling priority for worker processes like it is done by the nice command: a negative number means higher priority. Allowed range normally varies from -20 to 20.
# worker_rlimit_core;  # worker_rlimit_core size; Default: --; Context: main -- Changes the limit on the largest size of a core file (RLIMIT_CORE) for worker processes.
# worker_rlimit_nofile;  # worker_rlimit_nofile number; Default: --; Context: main -- Changes the limit on the maximum number of open files (RLIMIT_NOFILE) for worker processes.
# worker_shutdown_timeout;  # worker_shutdown_timeout time; Default: --; Context: main -- Configures a timeout for a graceful shutdown of worker processes. When the time expires, nginx will try to close all the connections currently open to facilitate shutdown.

pid  /run/nginx.pid;  # pid file; Default: pid logs/nginx.pid; Context: main -- Defines a file that will store the process ID of the main process.
lock_file  /run/nginx.lock;  # lock_file file; Default: lock_file logs/nginx.lock; Context: main -- nginx uses the locking mechanism to implement accept_mutex and serialize access to shared memory.
